# *Hello!*

I am a Computational Biologist--I use code to understand biological data.

I did my PhD at the University of Toronto and the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, where I developed and assessed computational methods to better determine genomic variants in complicated regions.

## Tools I developed
- [gbkc](https://github.com/hgibling/gbkc): genotyping by k-mer counts
- [gblr](https://github.com/hgibling/gblr): genotyping by long reads

## Additional work
- [*PRDM9* variants](https://github.com/hgibling/PRDM9-Variants): A list of all genomic variants of the gene PRDM9
- [Scripts and files from my PhD research](https://github.com/hgibling/PhD-Thesis): Not yet complete--I'm still organizing and uploading files
- [Teaching materials](https://github.com/hgibling/TeachingDossier): I like to teach others, particularly introductory coding and bioinformatics skills!
